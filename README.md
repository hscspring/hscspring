### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± I've used several programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, Java, Rust, Elixir, C++ in my past projects. Currentyly I'm learning ALL about Computer Science and AI.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on my open source projects.

I do believe that one's mission is as important as his life.
